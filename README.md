Enter Subterfuge, a Framework to take the arcane art of Man-in-the-Middle Attacks and make it as simple as point and shoot. Subterfuge demonstrates vulnerabilities in the ARP Protocol by harvesting credentials that go across the network and even exploiting machines by injecting malicious code directly into their browsing sessions.

How to use this Document

Reading through this entire document may be tedious, and will certainly deluge you in information you may not have any desire in knowing. To aid in your perusal below is a short summary of each section, so that you know where to go in order to get the information that you came for:

Introduction

This section is for those of you who are interested in where the Subterfuge Project came from, why it exists, and what we hope to accomplish. The introduction focuses on the risks of MITM attacks, the programmatic structure of Subterfuge, and the community buoying it up.

                     The Attack

                     The next portion of the documentation gets right into running Subterfuge.  It starts with the most basic usage, and moves on to basic module usage as well as settings and configuration options. 

                     Modules

                     Extending the attack through Plugins and Modules. This section takes an in depth look at how Subterfuge can really work for you. 

                     Troubleshooting

                     The most pervasive problem with hacking tools is that they never quite work right for everyone. Between the plethora of different builds we operate, and the differing conditions of each attack breaking things is almost inevitable. Here’s what to do to fix it.

                     Third-Party Tool Integration

                     Subterfuge doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and we didn’t design it that way. Here we discuss the external tools that the project leverages, and how they interact with the framework to make the penetration testing experience more fluid and dynamic.

                     Extending Subterfuge

                     Making Subterfuge work for you is easy. This portion of the documentation talks about just how to get deeper functionality out of the system. 

                     Contributing to the Project
